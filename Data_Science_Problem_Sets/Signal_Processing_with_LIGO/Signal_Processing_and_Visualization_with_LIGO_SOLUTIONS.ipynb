What they saw was the result of two black holes, each roughly 30 times the mass of the sun approximately 400 Mpc (1.3 billion light years) away. That event was so violent that approximately 3 solar masses were converted into energy (via $E = mc^2$) and released as gravitational radiation. \n",

That signal occupies a small fraction of the times and frequencies, so in order to see that we want to further break up the spectrum into different time bins, producing a [spectrogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrogram). This is a bit of a funny operation, since it's turning a 1D time series into a 2D plot. This is a achieved by breaking the data into blocks of size `NFFT`, taking the Fast Fourier Transform, then moving on to the next chunk. The larger the chunk, the better the frequency resolution, but the worse the temporal resolution. If this sounds familiar, it's because it's essentially a sort of [uncertainty principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_principle#Signal_processing).\n",
